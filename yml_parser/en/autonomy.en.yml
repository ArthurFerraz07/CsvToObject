            description: O cálculo do grau da diferença é realizado a partir da diferença
              das respostas do seu mapeamento e do automapeamento. A nível de função,
              leva em consideração os valores dados nas dimensões, sendo 0 a 2 baixa
              e 2 a 12 alta. Já a nível de atividade, utiliza os valores de autonomia
              dados para cada atividades, sendo 0 a 1 baixa e 1 a 12 alta.
